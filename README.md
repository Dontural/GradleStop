# GradleStop
**TLDR**: Basically it's a one-click shortcut for `gradlew --stop`.

A small plugin for IntelliJ IDEs that allows you to stop running Gradle process in one click.
For instance, it can help you cancel the building process.
Note that it requires you to have **gradlew** executable in the project directory (it's there by default when using Android Studio).

After the installation you can find **Gradle Stop** button on **Main Toolbar** and inside **Run Menu**.
